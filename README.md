### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variable scope: the scope of a variable is where a declared variable can be used in a code. If it is a global variable, it is declared outside of a function and can be used in all parts of the code. If it's a local variable, it is declared inside a function, and thus can only be used within that function it was declared in.
2. parseFloat function: the purpose of the parseFloat function is to convert the input by the user, which is a String, into Floats (numbers) which can then be calculated.
3. getElementById function: the getElementById function is used to identify the place on the HTML page where the output of the program will be placed.
